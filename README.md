POW-BANG-SWOOSH is a review/collection site for comics and manga. Users can add a series to the Series page, so other users can read or leave reviews on them. If you personlly own a series on the Series page, add it to your Collections page. POW-BANG-SWOOSH can serve as place to keep track of what you currently own. You can also see what other users are collecting to compare how your collection stacks up.

Don't want to sign in to a wonky site created by someone who is learning, no worries. You can still see the Series page and read reviews as a guest.
